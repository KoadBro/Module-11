# Module-11

For this challenge I used automated browsing to visit the Mars news siteLinks to an external site where0 I inspected the page to identify which elements to scrape.

I then created a Beautiful Soup object and used it to extract text elements from the website, extracted the titles and preview text of the news articles that I scraped, and stored the scraping results in Python data structures as seen in the files.

I stored each title-and-preview pair in a Python dictionary and, gave each dictionary two keys: title and preview thn stored all the dictionaries in a Python list.
